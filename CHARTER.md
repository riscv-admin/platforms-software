# Privileged Software Horizontal Committee Charter

The Privileged Software Horizontal Committee performs gap analysis, defines the strategy, and maintains a prioritised roadmap for the RISC-V privileged and system-level software: this encompasses firmware, bootloaders, platform services (e.g. UEFI), hypervisors and operating system kernels.
Inside RISC-V, it governs the development of specifications for these software components, provides sign-off on relevant ISA extensions, and establishes best practices for system-level software.
Interacting with the wider community and respective upstream projects within the committee's scope, it drives the outreach and coordination between RISC-V and the established open-source communitites.

This committee has four major topic areas: components, interfaces, operating systems, and platforms.
Platforms are special and under the direction and guidance of the TSC to develop platform specs that enable distros to have a releases that can run on multiple implementations.
Operating systems drive everything from Linux to FreeRTOS to Windows etc. Interfaces include things like SBIs, UEFI, PCI, UCIe, *ABI, â€¦ Components consist of things like  Hypervisor, Unified DIscovery, Platform security (works with Security HC). We expects SIGs in each of the four areas to provide long term strategy, gap analysis and prioritization on behalf of the committee.

This Committee heavily interacts with all of the other committees with emphasis with the Privileged ISA Committee and the Security and SOC Horizontal committees.
